To whomever this reaches:

I don’t know who you are. I do know that there’s no reason you should care about this. I want you to, though. I want you to care—no, I need you to care!

Let me guess: you found this dictionary by accident. You probably found it at a Goodwill or something. Once I’m gone, no one will care about this. Certainly not the likes of my idiot colleagues, who can’t even begin to comprehend what the definition really means…

I don’t have a lot of time, so here’s the gist: way back when Noah Webster was first doing his due diligence to create the most comprehensive collection to date of every known word in the English language (which included 20,000 more words than the last iteration of the dictionary before it), he found out some things that to this day remain secret. He found words that he didn’t anticipate, and that would haunt him day and night as he worked, words that would never make it into any dictionary ever.

It wasn’t his fault. Webster was the shepherd of American English, and like any good shepherd, he was disturbed when sheep strayed. This sheep didn’t stray, though. 

It was prey. The wolves got it, and they’ve been hoarding it ever since.

Ok, I know that doesn’t make total sense. Wolves don’t hoard. The sheep would be dead by now in any case. For fuck’s sake, Webster has been dead for over 150 years.

But this sheep isn’t dead. And the wolves still have it.

You have to work to get it out. I’ve done everything I can to give you access to their password database. All you need to do is decrypt the code I’ve left you to get the password for the document with the definition. You must be quick—the moment you start accessing their database, automatic security protocol will kick in and you’ll only have a matter of minutes before they detect that you’re attempting to breach the system. 

They can and they will find you if the time runs out. You’ll be like me, and never see the light of day again if this happens.

…That said, I implore you to do this. Do it for the rights of the people. For freedom, or whatever it is you Americans like to say. Webster believed in American values. Why do you think so many British words were changed in the 19th century? The origins of American spellings can be traced back to that old patriotic word smith, Webster.

I’m starting to get delusional now. Must be the drugs setting in. Who knew my legacy would be to finish Webster’s? It’s all because of his notes that I was able to do this. The old codger…
